When a user tries to access the app page or any api protected by session middleware, it should only allow them if they have a session, If they don't they should be redirected to the login page. Right now it doesn't do that. Can you fix this?



Now that the server redirects to login if the user is not authenticated, is the /api/auth-status route still needed?
