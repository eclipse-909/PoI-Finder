When I login, it shows this in the console:
app.js:5 POI Finder App initialized
app.js:11 Uncaught ReferenceError: initializeRouter is not defined
    at HTMLDocument.<anonymous> (app.js:11:2)
(anonymous) @ app.js:11
router.js:127 Template "index-template" not found
loadRoute @ router.js:127
navigate @ router.js:110
init @ router.js:51



When I submit the login credentials, nothing happens. It just brings me back to the login page



Logging in successfully authenticated me, but it doesn't bring me to the app page. When I log in, it should automatically bring me to the app page.



I am now able to get to the app page again. Can you comment out the parts that call the google maps api? Also, the tabs aren't working anymore



The tab buttons don't do anything when I click on them



I've copied the code back in since it was working before. Can you just clean it up for me and make sure it's working correctly, calling the right functions, and styled correctly?
