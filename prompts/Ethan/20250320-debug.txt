When I login, it shows this in the console:
app.js:5 POI Finder App initialized
app.js:11 Uncaught ReferenceError: initializeRouter is not defined
    at HTMLDocument.<anonymous> (app.js:11:2)
(anonymous) @ app.js:11
router.js:127 Template "index-template" not found
loadRoute @ router.js:127
navigate @ router.js:110
init @ router.js:51



When I submit the login credentials, nothing happens. It just brings me back to the login page



Logging in successfully authenticated me, but it doesn't bring me to the app page. When I log in, it should automatically bring me to the app page.



I am now able to get to the app page again. Can you comment out the parts that call the google maps api? Also, the tabs aren't working anymore



The tab buttons don't do anything when I click on them



I've copied the code back in since it was working before. Can you just clean it up for me and make sure it's working correctly, calling the right functions, and styled correctly?



are redirect.js, router.js, and tabs.js used anywhere in the @Codebase ?



This string should not be undefined, so it should jump to the server error if it is



Can you make it so it compiles the typescript code before doing the watch?



Can I make it have 2 prelaunchtasks instead



can I include shell commands in the task?



Can you put the "save preferences" button on the top of the page rather than the bottom?



Can you make it so the save preferences button is disabled, but it becomes enabled when the user makes any change to the preferences? The button should be disabled again when the preferences are saved and the server doesn't respond with an error.



When the button is disabled, it should be gray and non-interactable.



Can you make it so if an API key was not provided in the .env, you can still use the website. However, instead of attempting to call the API, it just responds with an error that the API key was not provided? On the frontend, it should just make an alert that the server is a debug build and doesn't have API keys set.



When the API key environemtn variable is set to "placeholder", that should also be considered missing.
