Can you change the database to postgres?



Can you switch the session store to postgres?



I got the following error when trying to login to the deployed website:
ValidationError: The 'X-Forwarded-For' header is set but the Express 'trust proxy' setting is false (default). This could indicate a misconfiguration which would prevent express-rate-limit from accurately identifying users. See https://express-rate-limit.github.io/ERR_ERL_UNEXPECTED_X_FORWARDED_FOR/ for more information.

I can login, but I'm getting this error now:
ValidationError: The Express 'trust proxy' setting is true, which allows anyone to trivially bypass IP-based rate limiting. See https://express-rate-limit.github.io/ERR_ERL_PERMISSIVE_TRUST_PROXY/ for more information.

Can you rewrite this prompt file by using less words and tokens? Please keep all of the content because all the information is important. Just try to reduce the token count where possible.



Can you make it so the context in the preferences has a word limit of 250 words? Enforce this on the client and server side.
