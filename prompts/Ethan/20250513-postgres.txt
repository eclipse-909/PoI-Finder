Can you change the database to postgres?



Can you switch the session store to postgres?



I got the following error when trying to login to the deployed website:
ValidationError: The 'X-Forwarded-For' header is set but the Express 'trust proxy' setting is false (default). This could indicate a misconfiguration which would prevent express-rate-limit from accurately identifying users. See https://express-rate-limit.github.io/ERR_ERL_UNEXPECTED_X_FORWARDED_FOR/ for more information.

I can login, but I'm getting this error now:
ValidationError: The Express 'trust proxy' setting is true, which allows anyone to trivially bypass IP-based rate limiting. See https://express-rate-limit.github.io/ERR_ERL_PERMISSIVE_TRUST_PROXY/ for more information.

Can you rewrite this prompt file by using less words and tokens? Please keep all of the content because all the information is important. Just try to reduce the token count where possible.



Can you make it so the context in the preferences has a word limit of 250 words? Enforce this on the client and server side.



in response.text, remove everything before and including ```json, and remove everything after and including ```



When I look at a saved search, the images on the cards don't load. It displays the file icon and the alt name. There are no errors in the browser or in the server console. This isn't a problem when I run the server on my laptop. This only happens when the server is running via the Render deployment.



Here's what happens when I try to fetch the image url from the console.

let img = await fetch("https://places.googleapis.com/v1/places/ChIJoUm4R9g93YkRXEJoAgzLwYo/photos/AXQCQNQpAbfQohr0VUgNZJg6g51QL-bxEEtDkCAqMnDynryCNymxGEkKCTWZZZSI8sS2rsItkqzo9gFSAq-pgCAe6TRmyFv83sjVkGNelzZz8HI_-5wi10tyhoKO2iZWFEw7bRJTGJBu_tJXMh5IUx7C1xwkIiUINbtncdnqZpFnq7Eq8jt81TUmcfWlYXuZcmLujlCKdHpT1f5HR5Q3Zh7bPBVF_TgB4jX9zVScrLs_86PL2bbH_TypBMSJI2mbjj7exvRNkYn3-pDI5P91zkB3k1BgDj-hXGYXcvsGnzWWiPnAbQ/media?maxHeightPx=200&key=AIzaSyDzliW579MLOevrhhNqO4163i7CE6r8Yzk");

In the browsers network tab, when it tries to load the image, it gets a 403 Forbidden error. It also says (failed) net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_ORB



Something weird is happening. I can sometimes see the images when I look at the cards. If I scroll through all the images, some of them load, but most don't. If I keep scrolling through multiple times, the same images won't necessarily load again. It almost seems random whether an image will load each time I try to load it.
