Can you change the database to postgres?



Can you switch the session store to postgres?



I got the following error when trying to login to the deployed website:
ValidationError: The 'X-Forwarded-For' header is set but the Express 'trust proxy' setting is false (default). This could indicate a misconfiguration which would prevent express-rate-limit from accurately identifying users. See https://express-rate-limit.github.io/ERR_ERL_UNEXPECTED_X_FORWARDED_FOR/ for more information.

I can login, but I'm getting this error now:
ValidationError: The Express 'trust proxy' setting is true, which allows anyone to trivially bypass IP-based rate limiting. See https://express-rate-limit.github.io/ERR_ERL_PERMISSIVE_TRUST_PROXY/ for more information.
