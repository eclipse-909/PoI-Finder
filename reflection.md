## How AI-assisted development
AI-assisted us in developing this application by developing the foundation ([20250316-init.txt](./prompts/Ethan/20250316-init.txt) & [20250317-meta_init.txt](./prompts/Ethan/20250317-meta_init.txt)) initially. The initial prompt was further refined through the use of meta-prompting to explore potential ways to plan out certain parts of the application that we haven't looked into yet.

After the initial prompts generated the baseline of the application, we started to use the prompts to help debug some problems ([20250320-debug.txt](./prompts/Ethan/20250320-debug.txt)). Although initially, AI could help smooth out some hindering bugs that we first encountered, it became evident that some issues were better resolved without the use of AI. Setting up a Google Map on the home page had to be done without AI code generation because it either didn't understand what we wanted, or it used the wrong API after providing it the link to the correct API. It was easier to read the documentation and examples to create a Google Map for our app.

## Challenges faced & solutions
During the debugging phase of our lab, we agreed that debugging manually was more efficient than having to write another prompt again and again to fix the issues. The AI could change some code but potentially still not fix the issue that was present. Although debugging manually was used, usage of AI prompts to help debug (notably troubleshooting issues on subjects we might not understand) was generally more helpful further down the line when the codebase became larger.

We only used AI for small fixes during debugging after most of the logic was written. Prompts were only a couple sentences, and they focused on a small portion of a single file. Some prompts did not even result in code generation. They were sometimes used to clarify code it generated, understand a concept, or learn API usage.

There were other issues such as having to clean up places where the AI had an idea going but did not end up finishing it. Due to this issue, a human review of the code would have been more appropriate, as having the AI scan for issues such as this would be harder.

## AI's impact on team collaboration
AI impacted team collaboration by allowing the other team members to view the prompts that one another has made, which allows seeing the ideas they were going for when making a prompt. In our scenario, however, only one person has made significant prompts. Documenting prompts is still beneficial for all team members because everyone can read them and understand the main idea of what they want the AI to generate.

AI's effectiveness however, dwindles the more the project is being developed, due to ideas being brought to fruition, which leads to AI usage dropping, and being more limited to just debugging issues that come up now and then. We used GitHub to manage issues, bugs, and features for the app. Smaller issues could sometimes benefit from AI help. It was nice to restrict the AI to only look at certain files. If multiple team members tried to work in the same files, or if multiple team members used AI to generate code in the same files, you would have to deal with merge conflicts. We did not have any merge conflicts. If the AI always had the context for the entire project, it would probably want to edit more files, and merge conflicts might arise.
