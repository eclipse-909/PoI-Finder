The program we are going to build is a travel planner. It will solve the problem of
finding things to do in an area that you are either visiting, or live in. The point of this,
is so that it can help guide potential tourists, or sightseers to local points of interests without having to ask around.
This will be done by having an application that allows users to use their current location or a location that they specify
to get the general points of interest in the area, alongside potentially an AI summary of what those places are that they can visit.

The core features that are present in the application are:
- The ability to search for points of interest in a given area.
- Providing the user a summary of things to do.
- An AI that helps guide the user(Potentially)
- Having the ability to save a list of locations.(Potentially a checklist)
- Potentially knowing the weather of the location or routes to the location.
- Knowing how long it would take to get to the location depending on the mode of transportation.
