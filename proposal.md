# Travel Planner App
## Problem Being Solved
Sometimes you want to find things to do in an area that you are either visiting, or live in. We want to help guide potential tourists or sightseers to local points of interests without having to ask around or blindly search the internet. This will be done by having an application that allows users to use their current location or a location that they specify to get the general points of interest in the area, alongside an AI summary of what those places are that they can visit.

## Planned Core Features
- The ability to search for points of interest in a given area.
- Providing the user a summary of things to do.
- An AI that helps guide the user(Potentially)
- Having the ability to save a list of locations.(Potentially a checklist)
- Potentially knowing the weather of the location or routes to the location.
- Knowing how long it would take to get to the location depending on the mode of transportation.

## AI Integration
We're not quite settled on the specifics, but we will likely have an AI API subscription. We don't know how we will be using it yet, but we have an idea of what we want to send and receive with the API.

## Technology Stack
We will be using TypeScript. The backend will be run with Node.js and Express for the server. We will not use a frontend framework. We will just use classic TypeScript, HTML, and CSS.
